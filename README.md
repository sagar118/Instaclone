# InstaClone

This repository contains my learning from Instagram-Clone-MERN-Stack course I took on udemy. Thanks to @mukeshphulwani66 for an amazing course.

To run the project:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Move to `client` directory and run `npm install`

Once all the dependencies are installed, we'll set up the environment config file name `.env` in the root folder.

The `.env` contains the following variables:

1. MONGO_URI
2. JWT_SECRET
3. JWT_LIFETIME
4. SG_API_KEY (API KEY from sendgrid for email)

Next to start the backend and frontend to view to application:

1. Run `npm start` (in root folder)
2. Move to `client` folder and run `npm start`
